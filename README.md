Due Date 9/12/2022

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Requirements
---

- When daily planner is opened the current date and time is shown at the top
- As I scroll down hourly time blocks are presented for a standard business hours
- each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future (like the picture below):

![color-coded calendar with colors for each hour of a business day.](./Assets/Images/hourswithcolor.jpg)

- clicking into a timeblock allows you enter a new event
- the save button style is specified by the fontawesome
- clicking the save button stores the value of the event into localstorage
- upton refresh calendar retrieves any saved events previously stored in localstorage. (like the picture below)
